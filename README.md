# Alzheimer-disease-detection
Alzheimer’s disease is the most common form of dementia and affects millions of individuals globally. It is a progressive neurological disorder that starts with mild memory loss and can eventually lead to severe cognitive decline, impacting a person’s ability to carry out daily activities or even hold a conversation. Since the disease mainly affects brain regions responsible for thought and memory, early and accurate diagnosis is essential for improving the quality of life and enabling more effective treatment strategies.

In this project, I focused on developing an automated system for identifying Alzheimer’s disease from MRI brain scans. My approach involves three main steps:

Feature Extraction using 
    1. PCA (Principal Component Analysis) – This reduces the dimensionality of the MRI data while preserving the most important information.

    2. Data Augmentation – To address the issue of limited data, I applied augmentation techniques to increase the size and diversity of the dataset.

    3. Classification using 2D CNN (Convolutional Neural Network) – A deep learning model is trained to classify the MRI images as either "Healthy" or "Alzheimer’s affected."

This end-to-end pipeline aims to enhance classification accuracy and improve upon existing methods in terms of performance and robustness.

The implementation of this model reflects my contribution toward leveraging AI and medical imaging to support early detection of Alzheimer’s disease, to aid medical professionals and researchers working in this critical field.


# Project Overview
Alzheimer's disease is a progressive neurological disorder that impairs memory, thinking ability, and behavior, eventually interfering with a person's daily functioning. As the most common form of dementia, it poses a significant health challenge, particularly among the aging population. Early diagnosis plays a vital role in managing symptoms and slowing disease progression, making automated detection methods increasingly valuable. This project aims to address this need by leveraging advanced machine learning techniques for the accurate classification of brain MRI scans. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is used to reduce the high dimensionality of MRI data, preserving key features while minimizing computational complexity. Following feature reduction, a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is employed to automatically learn spatial patterns and distinguish between healthy and Alzheimer-affected brains. To enhance model generalization and overcome data limitations, data augmentation techniques are applied to expand the training dataset. The resulting system demonstrates promising accuracy and efficiency, offering a step forward in the early detection of Alzheimer’s disease using AI-based medical imaging analysis.
