# Alzheimer-disease-detection
This project aims to detect Alzheimer's disease using a combination of Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). The project leverages advanced machine learning techniques to aid in the early diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease.
# Project Overview
Alzheimer's disease is a progressive neurological disorder that affects memory, thinking, and behavior. Early diagnosis is crucial for effective treatment and intervention. This project focuses on utilizing PCA to reduce the dimensionality of brain image data and CNNs to learn meaningful features from the images, resulting in a model that can classify brain scans as indicative of Alzheimer's disease or not.
